## My process

### Built with

- HTML5/
- SCSS
- JavaScript/jQuery

### Continued development

Flexboxs and grids aren't very familiar to me yet, also JS isn't my strongest point(especially jQuery), but I am working on it! Kind of embarrasing to say, but I took the JS code from here (https://codepen.io/daveredfern/pen/qVJgRo). I really don't understand jQuery that well yet, but I was so pleased how little amount of code there was and it does seem quite simple(at least when you know how to read and write it). I really wanna dive in to more JavaScript and get way better at it.

## Acknowledgments

- I got a lot of help from a YouTuber named [Coder Coder](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCoderCoder). I had already started this challenge but then got a bit stuck and I happened to find her video, where she was also completing the same challenge. I got really good tips from her.
